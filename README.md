# Snitz.NetCore

Snitz™ Forums 2000 is a web-based forum software developed by a group of independent programmers. It was designed as a solution for creating and managing online discussion boards or forums. It gained popularity during the early 2000s and was widely used by various online communities.

The software was originally written in ASP (Active Server Pages) and relied on a Microsoft Access database or in later versions, Microsoft SQL Server, for data storage. It provided a range of features common to forum platforms at the time, such as thread organization, user registration and profiles, private messaging, moderation tools, and customizable themes.


This version brings the Snitz™ Forums software right up to date using the latest Microsoft .NET Core technologies, allowing it to run natively on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It now uses EF Core enabling the Forum to work with SQL Server/Azure SQL Database, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and many more databases.
